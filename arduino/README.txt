The ino file contains all the code that controls the Arduino hardware such as the Fingerprint scanner, the stepper motor, the keypad, and the LCD. 

The Arduino branch contains the stubCode which tests the system without the stepper motor,  the Stepper_Driver tests the stepper motor independently, and the full_circuit which contains the code to control all the Arduino hardware.  

The Arduino branch is also the branch i used throughout the semester so all the commits will be displayed on that branch for the full_circuit code file.
